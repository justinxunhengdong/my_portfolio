		<h3>Synopsis</h3>
		<p>
			Oscar, a young, aspiring scientist, is experimenting with his brand new chemistry set in his treehouse when he accidentally cuts his finger. As his blood drips into a vial of chemicals, a bright flash and a loud bang occurs, and a ghostly girl appears from the smoke. A terrified Oscar gazes in equal parts fear and wonder at this mysterious girl, Autumn. She gains his trust by mixing some ecoplasm in a vial of chemicals, creating a beautiful sight, fascinating the young boy.
		</p>		

		<p>
			As evening approaches, Oscar starts to leave to eat dinner, but Autumn wants to keep playing, grabbing his hand. Though Oscar insists, Autumn won't leave him, tightening her grip as he begins to struggle. Finally, Autumn telekinetically slams the treehouse door shut, and reveals her true demonic form, red lightning flashing from within the treehouse.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next season, the treehouse is barren and decrepit, the tree bare and dying. The camera slowly reveals two skulls lying at the base of the tree, and the faint echo of the laughter and screaming of two children, playing together forever.
